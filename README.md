## Requirements
- pip install -r requirements.txt

## Documentation
- [Here](https://subhadityamukherjee.github.io/DMASB07-ProtestersVsPolice/)

## Better commits + free documentation website :)
- This will auto format all the codes and sort the imports so you don't have to, creates a documentation website etc
- If you are running Linux/Mac/WSL, while pushing to the repository run
- chmod +x pusher.sh (just once. This makes it executable)
- Next time you want to push your changes just do ./pusher.sh "commit_name"
