# Protesters vs Cops

## Better commits
- This will auto format all the codes and sort the imports so you don't have to
- If you are running Linux/Mac/WSL, while pushing to the repository run
- chmod +x pusher.sh (just once. This makes it executable)
- Next time you want to push your changes just do ./pusher.sh "commit_name"
